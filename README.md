# Java-Overview

> Java is a high-level, object-oriented programming language known for its portability across platforms using the JVM (Java Virtual Machine).  

> It is widely used for building web applications, mobile apps, enterprise systems, and more.  

> Java follows the principle of "write once, run anywhere", making it highly versatile.  

> Its working process involves writing code, compiling it into bytecode, and running it on the JVM.  

> Java's robust libraries and frameworks make it a top choice for scalable applications.
